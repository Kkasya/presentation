            <div class="terms">

                <p>Although the term “Open Source Software” has only recently claimed widespread use, this phrasing
                    originates in the American “hacker” culture of the 1960’s and 70’s.</p>
                <p>More specifically, the practices behind the term are attributed to key individuals working in the
                    computer science laboratories of Stanford, Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon and MIT.</p>

            <h2>Why open source is right</h2>
            <p class="justify">Open source licensing encourages innovation through collaboration. Without it, many of the technologies we take for granted today would never have developed, or would be locked away behind patent law.</p>
            <p class="justify">The open source movement is the reason that technology has developed at such a breakneck pace for the past few decades.</p>
